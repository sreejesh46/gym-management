# 🏋️‍♂️ Gym Management System

A web-based Gym Management System built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase. This project allows gym admins to manage members, create bills, assign fee packages, and communicate via notifications. Members can log in to view their bills, diet plans, and supplements.

## 📋 Problem Statement
Payment receipts at many gyms are printed on paper, making them hard to manage and easy to lose. Manual notifications and record-keeping are inefficient. This project digitizes receipts, notifications, and member management for improved safety, convenience, and reliability.
